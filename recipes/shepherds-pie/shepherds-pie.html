    alt="Delicious Shepherd's Pie">
    <p>Shepherd's pie is a favorite of mine. It's easy to make and it's easy 
        to store for later. This is a great dish for weekly meal preps. It's 
        great for taking to work.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons(1 stick) of butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups mixed vegetables, such as diced carrots, corn, 
            or peas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Pepper and/or other seasonings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong> Boil the potatoes: </strong><p>Place the peeled and quartered
            potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of
            cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce 
            to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Preheat the Oven</strong><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong> Saute the vegetables: </strong><p>While potatoes
            are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of butter in large saute pan on
            medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 
            6 to 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>If you are including vegetables, add them according to their
            cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they
            take as long to cook as the onions do.
            </p>
            <p>If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the 
            cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they
            take very little cooking time.
            </p>

        <li><strong> Add the ground beef, then the Worcestershire sauce and 
            broth: </strong>
            <p>Add ground beef to the pan with the onion and vegetables. Cook until
            no longer pink. Drain the pan of excess fat, if necessary (anything 
            more than 1 tablespoon). Season with salt and pepper.
            </p>
            <p>Add the Worcerstershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth 
            to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes,
            adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.
            </p>
            <p>Taste the cooked filling and, if needed, add more salt, peppers, 
            Worcestershire, or other seasonings of your choice.

        </li>
        
        <li><strong> </strong>
            <p>When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), 
            remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the 
            remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with fork or potato 
            masher, taste, and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.
            </p></li>

        <li><strong> Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole
            dish:</strong>
            
            <p>Spread the cookid filling in an even layer in a large baking dish 
            (such as a 9 x 13-inch casserole).
            </p>
            
            <p>Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up 
            the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that 
            will get browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in 
            the mashed potatoes.

            alt="beef and veggies in baking pan topped with mashed potatoes">
        
        <li><strong> Bake in oven: </strong>
            
            <p>Place in a 400 degree fahrenheit oven and cook until browned and 
                bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few 
                minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.
            </p>
            
            <p>(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have
                been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's 
                not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Suggested variations:</strong></p>
            
            <p><em>Put a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the 
                mashed potatoes.</em>
            </p>
            
            <p><em>Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed
                potatoes before baking.
            </em></p>
